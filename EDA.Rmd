### Question 3: Evaluating Data Quality

This question encourages you to begin the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for your final project. By addressing potential data quality issues early, you can identify and rectify problems promptly. For each important variable in your dataset, assess its quality by creating a table that includes the following:

-   **Continuous variables**:
    -   The number of non-missing observations.
    -   The number of missing observations.
    -   Measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median).
    -   Measures of variability (e.g., standard deviation, interquartile range [IQR]).
-   **Categorical variables**:
    -   The levels of the variable.
    -   For each level:
        -   The number of non-missing observations.
        -   The number of missing observations.

### Answer: Comparing Predictive Performance of Betting Markets and Polls

Our project aims to compare the predictive accuracy of betting markets and polls in forecasting the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election by state. We use the following datasets:

1.  **Betting Market Data**
    -   Sourced from a Kaggle dataset, this dataset scrapes Polymarket's 2024 election results by state and consolidates them into a CSV file ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pbizil/polymarket-2024-us-election-state-data)).
2.  **Poll Data**
    -   Sourced from FiveThirtyEight, this dataset provides polling averages and raw data from the 2024 U.S. presidential election ([source](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/)).
3.  **Actual Election Results**
    -   Sourced from CBS News, this dataset reports the official 2024 presidential election results ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2024/president/)).

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Dataset 1: Betting Market Data**

The dataset provides separate files for each state, containing the probability of a Republican win under the column "Donald Trump" and a Democratic win under "Kamala Harris." These probabilities are based on the amount bet on Polymarket for each candidate. Data was aggregated by month, resulting in a final dataset of state-level probabilities for Republican and Democratic wins from April 17, 2024, to November 4, 2024. 


Columns Included "Date (UTC)","Timestamp (UTC)","Donald Trump","Kamala Harris", and "Other". All values of the table were continuous, enumerating the date, time, percentage probability for Trump, percentage probability for Kamala, and percentage probability for a different candidate. No cateogrical variables existed.

First non-missing and missing observations were quantified for each probability column. Mean probabilities and standard deviations for Republican and Democratic wins nationwide were calculated.

    total_non_missing = sum(!is.na(percentage)),
    total_missing = sum(is.na(percentage))
  )

#print(missing_data_summary)

#print(nationwide_stats)

```

While we will be aggregating over time, we nevertheless ran a missing information test on data and timestamp.

```{r}
missing_data_summary <- data.frame()

for (file in file_list) {
  state_data <- read_csv(file, show_col_types = FALSE)
  
  # Extract the state abbreviation from the file name
  state_abbrev <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(file)) %>% 
    stringr::str_extract("^[A-Z]{2}")
  
  # Count missing and non-missing observations for each candidate
  non_missing_date <- sum(!is.na(state_data$`Date (UTC)`))
  missing_date <- sum(is.na(state_data$`Date (UTC)`))
  non_missing_timestamp <- sum(!is.na(state_data$`Timestamp (UTC)`))
  missing_timestamp <- sum(is.na(state_data$`Timestamp (UTC)`))
  
  # Append missing data summary for this state
  missing_data_summary <- bind_rows(
    missing_data_summary,
    data.frame(
      state = state_abbrev,
      variable = "Date",
      non_missing = non_missing_date,
      missing = missing_date
    ),
    data.frame(
      state = state_abbrev,
      variable = "Timestamp",
      non_missing = non_missing_timestamp,
      missing = missing_timestamp
    )
  )
}

#print(missing_data_summary)

```

We have no missing data in the csv files for each state, suggesting this dataset is good to go.

**Dataset 2: Poll Data**

The dataset contains average polling data by candidate, date, and their adjusted percentage of being favored. We started out by exploring how many missing and non-missing data point there were for Harris and Trump. We then aggregated data over time, such that we are left with poll percentages for Harris/Trump per state. We take the mean to find the average poll percentage for Harris and Trump nationwide. We then take the standard deviation.



```{r}
polling_data <- read.csv("data/polls_data/538_data/polls_average_2024.csv")
```

```{r}
#isolate 2024 polling data (there are many rwos from 2020 in here with no values)
polling2024 <- polling_data %>%
  filter(cycle == 2024) %>%
  #take out the pct_trend_adjusted column (it's NA everywhere)
  select(- pct_trend_adjusted)

```

```{r}
#categorical variables - checking for missing data
# **Categorical variables**:
#     -   The levels of the variable.
#     -   For each level:
#         -   The number of non-missing observations.
#         -   The number of missing observations.

#cat variables - candidate, date, state, cycle, party

cat_vars <- c("candidate", "date", "state", "cycle", "party")

#function which calculates number of levels, and missing observations for each column

cat_eda <- function(data, vars) {
  
  levels <- numeric(length(cat_vars))
  nas <- numeric(length(cat_vars))
  non_nas <- numeric(length(cat_vars))
  
  #iterate through cat varaibles
  for (i in 1:5) {
    col <- vars[i]
    #update values appropriately
    levels[i] <- length(unique(data[[col]]))
    nas[i] <- sum(is.na(data[[col]]))
    non_nas[i] <- length(data[[col]]) - nas
  }
  
   #put results into table
   results <- data.frame(
    Variable = vars,
    Levels = levels,
    Missing = nas,
    NonMissing = non_nas)
   
   return(results)
}

cat_eda(polling2024, cat_vars)
```
Notable things - not all 50 states are represented, since we only have 30 levels for the state. Only one cycle is represented here - further analysis on this might require addition of other cycles to corroborate results. Also, there are no missing data values (Except for the column that we dropped which was entirely empty) - very clear data set... and there are 4 candidates represented, although in later terms there are only 2 as people dropped out of the race. 

Interesting things to potentially look at - could Biden's initial run be understood as a separate "mini" race within this election? Can we use that as a different case study?

  # **Continuous variables**:
  #   -   The number of non-missing observations.

cont_vars <- c("pct_estimate", "hi", "lo")

cont_eda <- function(data, vars) {
  l <- length(cont_vars)
  mean <- numeric(l)
  median <- numeric(l)
  sd <- numeric(l)
  iqr <- numeric(l)
  nas <- numeric(l)
  non_nas <- numeric(l)

  
  #iterate through cont varaibles
  for (i in 1:l) {
    col <- vars[i]
    #update values appropriately
    x <- data[[col]]
    nas[i] <- sum(is.na(x))
    non_nas[i] <- length(x) - nas
    mean[i] <- mean(x)
    median[i] <- median(x)
    sd[i] <- sd(x)
    iqr[i] <- IQR(x)
  }
  
   #put results into table
   results <- data.frame(
    Variable = vars,
    Missing = nas,
    NonMissing = non_nas,
    Mean = mean,
    Median = median,
    IQR = iqr,
    StandardDeviation = sd)
   
   return(results)
}

cont_eda(polling2024, cont_vars)

```
```{r}
#polling information by state
polling_bystate <- polling2024 %>% 
  filter(candidate == "Trump" | candidate == "Harris") %>%
  group_by(state, candidate) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(pct_estimate), 
          median = median(pct_estimate),
          sd = sd(pct_estimate), 
          iqr = IQR(pct_estimate))

polling_bystate
```
Things to think about - again, we have no missing values, so there are no missing values throughout this entire dataset. This gives us a good idea for around where the range hovers (i.e. there was no clear winner), which gives evidence that this is an interesting question (since if there was an obvious winner, the additional granularity of the betting data might be useless because the answer is so obvious.) It might be interesting that the range of the the highs is actually lower than the lows, but the standard deviations are all relatively similar. Looking by state also gives us some interesting information!

**Dataset 3: Election Results**

The dataset contains the number of votes for Harris and Trump, separated by state. We find the percentage who voted for Harris and Trump, the amount of missing and non-missing data, and the mean and variance.

**Final Thoughts**

The analysis highlights that all three datasets—betting market data, polling data, and actual election results—are well-structured with minimal to no missing values, giving us reliable and comprehensive insights. The lack of missing data facilitates robust comparisons across datasets, allowing us to evaluate the predictive accuracy of betting markets and polls effectively. Interestingly, the variability observed in polling data and betting market probabilities reflects the competitiveness of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, showing the value of nuanced data sources for prediction. This data can provide a glimpse into how markets can be telltales of current political trends.

## Baseline Model

Let's start by reading in the actual data and manipulating it such that we have a column titles 'trump_win' where a 1 denotes a state he won and a 0 denotes a state he lost.

```{r}
results <- read.csv("data/actual_results_data/state_results_2024.csv")
results <- results %>%
mutate(trump_win = case_when(Trump_Votes > Harris_Votes ~ 1,
Trump_Votes < Harris_Votes ~ 0))

results <- results %>%
mutate(
percent_harris = (Harris_Votes / (Harris_Votes + Trump_Votes)) * 100,
percent_trump = (Trump_Votes / (Harris_Votes + Trump_Votes)) * 100
)
```

```{r}
colnames(final_data)[colnames(final_data) == "state"] <- "State"
final_data$State <- state.name[match(final_data$State, state.abb)]
final_data <- left_join(final_data, results, by = "State")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
betting_data <- final_data %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = candidate, 
    values_from = percentage, 
    names_prefix = "percentage_"
  )

colnames(betting_data) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(betting_data))

head(betting_data)
```

```{r}
betting_model <- lm(trump_win ~ `percentage_Donald_Trump` + `percentage_Kamala_Harris`, data = betting_data)
summary(betting_model)
```

```{r}
polling_bystate <- polling2024 %>%
filter(candidate == "Trump" | candidate == "Harris") %>%
group_by(state, candidate) %>%
summarize(mean = mean(pct_estimate),
median = median(pct_estimate),
sd = sd(pct_estimate),
iqr = IQR(pct_estimate))
```

```{r}
polls_data <- polling_bystate %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = candidate,
    values_from = c(median, sd, iqr, mean) 
  )

head(polls_data)
```

```{r}
colnames(polls_data)[colnames(polls_data) == "state"] <- "State"
polls_data <- left_join(polls_data, results, by = "State")

polling_model <- lm(trump_win ~ mean_Harris + mean_Trump, data = polls_data)

summary(polling_model)
```

```{r}
betting_data$predictions <- predict(betting_model, betting_data)

polls_data$predictions <- predict(polling_model, polls_data)
```

```{r}
colnames(polls_data)[colnames(polls_data) == "state"] <- "State"

polling_model <- lm(trump_win ~ mean_Harris + mean_Trump, data = polls_data)

summary(polling_model)
```

```{r}
betting_data$predictions <- predict(betting_model, betting_data)

polls_data$predictions <- predict(polling_model, polls_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(betting_data, aes(x = predictions, y = percent_trump)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Betting Model Predictions vs Actual", x = "Predicted Probability", y = "Actual Outcome")

ggplot(polls_data, aes(x = predictions, y = percent_trump)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Poll Model Predictions vs Actual", x = "Predicted Probability", y = "Actual Outcome")

```

We see from the figures above that comparing the baseline models from the polling data and the betting data, that the polling data currently seems to be much more accurate. However, we hope to explore if that statement stills holds once we adjust our models and improve their accuracy.
